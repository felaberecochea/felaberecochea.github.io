    "text": "Physical activity has gained a lot of attention in the past decades given the body of evidence that supports its benefits to different health outcomes, in specific to hypokinetic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and even cancer. To prevent and treat these diseases, it is important to understand the complex pathways that leads people to exercise more. Green spaces are known to provide multiple benefits to the wellness and health of the population and had been proposed to be an important mediator to increase levels of physical activity. Hence, we wanted to study if there is an association between green spaces and physical fitness in young adults."

Physical Fitness\nPhysical activity and physical fitness are often used interchangeably in literature, yet each term carries distinct definitions and implications.  Physical activity refers to bodily movement generated by the contraction of skeletal muscle, resulting in increased energy expenditure above basal levels.
