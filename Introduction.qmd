# Introduction

Low physical activity (LPA) has been linked to numerous major non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, colon and breast cancers, mental health disorders, and premature mortality [@corbin2007; @xu2022a]. These conditions are collectively known as hypokinetic diseases, a term introduced by @kraus1961 to characterize the spectrum of conditions caused by insufficient physical activity. Many of these medical conditions are preventable or can be mitigated through regular physical activity participation [@cardinal2016]. Despite advancements, cardiovascular diseases have remained the world’s leading cause of death for at least the past three decades, accounting for 16% of the world’s total deaths [@who2020]. Heightening this crisis, diabetes has surged into the top 10 causes of death, experiencing a significant 70% increase since 2000 [@ihme2020; @who2020a]. A recent analysis of the Global Burden of Disease study revealed that although global age-standardized DALYs and death rates of disease attributable to LPA (DALPA) showed significant declines, the DALPA displayed notable upward trends from 1990 to 2019 in the 15-49 age group [@xu2022]

## Physical Activity v. Physical Fitness

Physical activity and physical fitness are often used interchangeably in literature, yet each term carries distinct definitions and implications.  Physical activity refers to bodily movement generated by the contraction of skeletal muscle, resulting in increased energy expenditure above basal levels. Certain physical activities contribute to physical fitness [@surgeon1996].
